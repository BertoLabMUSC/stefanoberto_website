abstract: Recent discussions of human brain evolution have largely focused on increased neuron numbers and changes in their connectivity and expression. However, it is increasingly appreciated that oligodendrocytes play important roles in cognitive function and disease. Whether both cell-types follow similar or distinctive evolutionary trajectories is not known. We examined the transcriptomes of neurons and oligodendrocytes in the frontal cortex of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We identified human-specific trajectories of gene expression in neurons and oligodendrocytes and show that both cell-types exhibit human-specific upregulation. Moreover, oligodendrocytes have undergone accelerated gene expression evolution in the human lineage compared to neurons. The signature of acceleration is enriched for cell type-specific expression alterations in schizophrenia. These results underscore the importance of oligodendrocytes in human brain evolution.
